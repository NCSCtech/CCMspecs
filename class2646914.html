<li>codeList:<br /><div class="sub">0=Unknown - Capture technology not provided by sensor manufacturer.; 1=Other - Capture technology not sufficiently characterized by table.; 10=Capactive _ radio frequency (RF) - A contact technology in which the capacitance of the friction ridge skin is assessed via a radiated RF signal.; 11=Electro-luminescent (EL) optical direct imaging - A contact technology in which the ridges and an alternating current (AC) signal cause an EL panel to emit light which is captured by an imaging system.; 12=Reflected ultrasonic image - A contact technology in which the friction ridge reflects ultrasonic energy which is assessed by the sensor.; 13=Ultrasonic impediography - A contact technology in which the absorption of ultrasonic energy is measured by changes in the impedance of a piezo-electric material.; 14=Thermal imaging - A contact technology in which the sensor measures the heat reflected from the friction ridge skin in contact with the sensor.; 15=Direct pressure sensitive - A contact technology in which the pressure of the fingerprint ridge skin against a material is measured.; 16=Indirect pressure - A contact technology in which the pressure of the fingerprint ridge skin against a deformable material is assessed optically to produce a friction ridge image.; 17=Live tape (one time use) - A technology in which tape is used on friction ridge skin to collect friction ridge detail and the tape is then Subsequently imaged by traditional photography.; 18=Latent impression - A capture process in which the digital image of the latent impression is acquired directly from the latent impression, using a scanner or digital camera.; 19=Latent photo - Physical photograph of the latent impression subsequently scanned using a flatbed scanner or digital camera.; 2=Scanned ink on paper - Ink applied to friction ridge skin and then applied to *paper, typically with assistance from a trained technician.; 20=Latent molded / cast impression - A capture process in which a mold / cast is taken from a latent friction ridge and then subsequently a _duplicate_ is generated from moldable / printable material and imaged.; 21=Latent tracing - An older legacy latent friction ridge capture process in which a hand-drawn or computer-drawn tracing would subsequently be imaged by a flatbed scanner or photographed.; 22=Latent lift - A process in which powder or a chemical is applied to a latent friction ridge print, subsequently transparent tape is applied to lift the print from the latent surface, and the tape is then placed on paper to be imaged.; 3=Optical _ Total Internal Reflection (TIR) _ bright field - Using optical angle of incidence effects, a contact livescan device captures ridge information such that ridges absorb light, and absence of ridges reflects light back to the sensor (dark ri; 4=Optical _ TIR _ dark field 4 Using optical angle of incidence effects, a contact livescan device captures ridge information such that ridges reflect light, and absence of ridges absorb light (white ridges on a dark background).; 5=Optical direct imaging - native - Light reflected from the friction ridge is imaged, resulting in a light gray on darker gray image. This may be performed contact or contactless, and may incorporate merging images from multiple sensors or rocking or; 6=Optical direct imaging _ low frequency unwrapped - Light reflected from the friction ridge is imaged onto one or more sensors. This may be performed contact or contactless, and utilizes the low frequency 3D detail to _unwrap_ or project the image te; 7=3-dimensional imaging _ high frequency unwrapped - High frequency friction ridge information is collected (optically, acoustically, etc.) and then _unwrapped_ to create a 2D image from the 3D point cloud or mesh.; 8=Reserved; 9=Capacitive - A contact technology in which the capacitance of the friction ridge skin is assessed via a conducted AC signal.; </div></li>
