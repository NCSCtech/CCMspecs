<li>codeList:<br /><div class="sub">EFLR=Image with device present that retracts the lips; EFNS=The subject's face without any incisions performed by the medical examiner or coroner.; EFOL=Left - Image should fill at least 90% of the image and extend from above the top of the head to the inferior border of the hyoid bone. The subject's head is rotated 45_. This position is independent of the size of the nose in contrast to the al; EFOR=Right - Image should fill at least 90% of the image and extend from above the top of the head to the inferior border of the hyoid bone. The subject's head is rotated 45_. This position is independent of the size of the nose in contrast to the a; EFPL=Left - Image should fill at least 90% of the image and extend from above the top of the head to the inferior border of the hyoid bone. The head should be positioned so that the ala-tragus line is parallel to the floor of the jaw in the rest position; EFPR=Right - Image should fill at least 90% of the image and extend from above the top of the head to the inferior border of the hyoid bone. The head should be positioned so that the ala-tragus line is parallel to the floor of the jaw in the rest positio; EFWI=Image taken after incisions made that were part of the examination of the subject; IBLB=The image should extend from the left canines to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left second molars should be included.; IBLL=The image should extend from the left mandibular canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left mandibular second molar should be included.; IBLR=The image should extend from the right mandibular canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right mandibular second molar should be included.; IBRB=The image should extend from the right canines to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right second molars should be included.; IBUL=The image should extend from the left maxillary canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left maxillary second molar should be included.; IBUR=The image should extend from the right maxillary canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right maxillary second molar should be included.; ICL=This view should be centered on the left oral linea alba and should include the left parotid papilla.; ICR=This view should be centered on the right oral linea alba and should include the right parotid papilla.; IFJB=The image shows the full set of teeth, including anterior teeth as well as a partial view of the premolar and possibly the first molar region. This is the most common code associated with an intraoral frontal view.; IFJL=The image is taken from the front of the mouth and shows a view of the upper (maxillary) teeth. This code should be selected when there are no lower teeth present on the subject.; IFJU=The image is taken from the front of the mouth and shows a view of the upper (maxillary) teeth. This code should be selected when the lower jaw is not present on the subject or there are no upper teeth present on the subject.; ILL=This image should be captured of the mandibular vestibule if there is a significant finding (i.e., tattoo or oral lesion) or an abnormality of the inferior labial frenulum such as connecting to the palate between the front teeth.; ILLB=The image should extend from the left canines to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left second molars should be included.; ILLF=The image should include left mandibular canine to right mandibular canine.; ILLL=The image should extend from the left mandibular canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left mandibular second molar should be included.; ILLR=The image should extend from the right mandibular canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right mandibular second molar should be included.; ILRB=The image should extend from the right canines to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right second molars should be included.; ILU=This image should be captured of the maxillary vestibule if there is a significant finding (i.e., tattoo or oral lesion) or an abnormality of the superior labial frenulum such as connecting to the palate between the front teeth.; ILUF=The image should include left maxillary canine to right maxillary canine.; ILUL=The image should extend from the left maxillary canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the left maxillary second molar should be included.; ILUR=The image should extend from the right maxillary canine to as far distally as possible. Ideally the right maxillary second molar should be included.; IOLA=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the mandibular first molar.; IOLF=This image should contain the occlusal surface of the teeth from left mandibular canine to right mandibular canine.; IOLL=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the mandibular first molar.; IOLR=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the mandibular first molar.; IOUA=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the maxillary first molar.; IOUF=This image should contain the occlusal surface of the teeth from left maxillary canine to right maxillary canine.; IOUL=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the maxillary first molar.; IOUR=This view should include all anterior teeth, all premolars and at least the maxillary first molar.; IPB=This view is focused upon the soft tissue at the back of the mouth. It should include the uvula and oropharynx regions.; IPC=This should be a centered view of the palate.; ITL=This view should be taken with the tongue raised or in retroflex position, centered on the frenulum.; ITU=This view should be taken with the tongue as flat as possible.; </div></li>
