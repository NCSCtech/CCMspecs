<p>The attributes uomLabels and axisLabels, defined in the SRSInformationGroup attribute group, are optional additional and redundant information for a CRS to simplify the processing of the coordinate values when a more complete definition of the CRS is not needed. This information shall be the same as included in the complete definition of the CRS, referenced by the srsName attribute. When the srsName attribute is included, either both or neither of the axisLabels and uomLabels attributes shall be included. When the srsName attribute is omitted, both of these attributes shall be omitted.<br />The attribute axisLabels is an ordered list of labels for all the axes of this CRS. The gml:axisAbbrev value should be used for these axis labels, after spaces and forbidden characters are removed. When the srsName attribute is included, this attribute is optional. When the srsName attribute is omitted, this attribute shall also be omitted.<br />The attribute uomLabels is an ordered list of unit of measure (uom) labels for all the axes of this CRS. The value of the string in the gml:catalogSymbol should be used for this uom labels, after spaces and forbidden characters are removed. When the axisLabels attribute is included, this attribute shall also be included. When the axisLabels attribute is omitted, this attribute shall also be omitted.<br /></p>
